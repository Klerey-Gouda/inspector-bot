# inspector-bot

This is a discord bot written with discord.py by me.
It is use a butler with many different commands.

###Command List

This is the list of command you can use. Prefix: =

**=addrole**
This command required manage role permission. It can be use to give any role as long as the bot's role is higher than that role. =addrole {@target} {@role}

**=removerole**
This command required manage role permission. It can be use to remove any role as long as the bot's role is higher than that role. =removerole {@target} {@role}

**=lootbox**
This command is a like a gacha machine. It will random a number between 1 to 500. If you got 69 or 420, you will get a special role!

**=play**
Play any music! Use: =play {url} The command has a slight delay of 10 second to 1 minute. Please be patient. In addition, there is a bug right now with this function, if the bot are in a voice chat before you use this command it will not work. This issue will be fix soon. Solution for right now is to use command =leave every time before playing a new song

**=leave**
Made the bot leave the voice chat

**=rroll**
I do not have much to say about it... JUST TRY IT OUT. VERY RECOMMENDED

**=yesno**
Ask any yes or no question. Use: =yesno {Question}

**=vote**
Let any memeber create a poll for anything. Any question or answer need to be put in a quotation mark. Use: =vote "{Question}" "{Answer1}" "{Answer2}"
